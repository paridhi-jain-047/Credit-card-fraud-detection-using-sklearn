# 💳Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-sklearn

This project is build using machine learning algorithms named as:-

1. Isolation Forest Algorithm
2. Local Outlier Factor

Earlier, People used to detect fraudulents in credit card transactions using basic classifier models like decision tree, random forest, SVM, k-nearest neighbors , logisitic regression, etc. But these are some newly discovered techniques which works well in terms of accuracy_score, and overall classification_report. 

Please check out the .ipnb file attached in this repo for more information.

Hope you find it useful.
